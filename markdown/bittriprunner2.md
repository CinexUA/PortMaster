## Notes

You'll need to source your own Linux version of BitTrip Runner2 game, and copy your Linux Game files (runner2, Runner2.png, package.toc and the other 9 folders) to the bittriprunner2 folder. 

Beware of a certain thing with the intro, where an unskippable black screen will appear for a few seconds, followed by the narator talking, after which a normal skippable intro proceeds.
